# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. This change log follows the conventions of [keepachangelog.com](http://keepachangelog.com/).

## 0.1.0-SNAPSHOT

### Added

- key-pressed? mouse-pressed? (and other event values) functions available in `draw-fn` (via Window protocols)
- lerp in color (to interpolate colors)
- set-stroke-custom - to set custom stoke pattern
- to-XXX* / from-XXX* are now normalized (0-255) colorspace conversion functions.
- color distances
- color interpolators
- color preset palettes (Brewer, Tableaus, Microsoft)
- color gradients
- color tweaking functions
- font-ascent

### Changed

- project dependencies to external `generateme/fastmath` library
- to-luma -> luma, get-hue -> hue
- hue returns angle (0 - 360)
- make-color, make-awt-color, make-canvas, make-2d-...-array changed to names without `make-` prefix
- make-pixels -> pixels
- make-effect* -> effect
	- almost all make- in raymarching are changed to version without prefix
- `resize-image` and `resize-canvas` are now moved to ImageProto as `resize`
- xor-mode, gradient-mode are reset with paint-mode
- to-XXX/from-XXX in colorspaces are raw conversions now
- YXY renamed to Yxy
- make-color-converter -> color-converter
- paletton-palette -> paletton
- signal processing refactored, api changed
- overlays refactored

Prefix `make-` is reserved when function is created.

### Fixed

- set-font works now

### Removed

- math namespaces moved to `generateme/fastmath` project
- examples moved to separate repository

## 0.0.7

### Added

- `with-canvas` is no longer threading macro (use `with-canvas->` for that)
- `:setup` parameter added to `show-window`. It's run before displaying window. Parameters are: canvas (within context) and window. When returned value is not `nil` it's used as initial state. In other case `:draw-state` parameter is used.
- color can be represented as int (eg. in hex form like: 0x234344)
- `clamp255` returns double, for long version call `lclamp255`
- bezier and curve functions added
- date/time functions (year, month, day, hour, minute, sec, millis, nanos)
- new function `filled-with-stroke` - to draw primitive with stroke and filled
- `load-bytes` added
- general key-event added (like mouse-event). You can now dispatch also on event type not only key char or code
- background supports transparency
- screen-width and screen-height functions

### Fixed

- threshold filter wrong values
- `draw` now displays exception when something is wrong
- window canvas was in the bad size causing visual artifacts
- more accurate frame delay calculations

### Changed

- `with-canvas` is renamed to `with-canvas->`
- `:highest` hint added (it's `:high` with Stroke Pure)
- :right, :left or :center alignments for text (last parameter, default :left)
- `rendering-hints` is map of vectors now, it gave 25% speed gain during recreating graphics context

## 0.0.5-0.0.6 - 2017-11-21

### Added

- Vcf303, Echo and BassTreble signal processing effects + example 16 updated
- key-released and key-typed events added
- fractal bestiary explorer - example 37
- path-bezier - bezier spline
- text and font functions
- Java2D convolution filters (via (convolve ...)), returning image
- Expectations Tests
- ArrayVec type - doubles array vector representation (for speed gain)

### Changed

- Overlays API changed to image + configuration map
- Switched from clojure math to primitive math library
- FastMath bindings changed to macros for several methods
- Saving picture moved to image protocol, replaced save-canvas and save-pixels removed (call (save canvas name)).
- KeyEvent protocols
- vector scale -> set-mag
- fixes after tests

### Fixed

- rgb scanlines bad tint values
- subpixel accuracy for strokes included in :high canvas profile

## 0.0.4 - 2017-08-07

### Added

- New overlay - crt scanlines

### Changed

- Events and Window carry global state, `show-window` parameters reorganized.

## 0.0.3 - 2017-07-02
### Added

- Canvas transformations (transpose, rotate, scale, push/pop matrix)
- Image protocol (get-image, width and height fns) for Window, Canvas, image, Pixels
- Mouse position protocol to Window and MouseEvent
- Nature of Code examples
- html 140 colors defined in color namespace (access by (c/to-color :name) or (set-color canvas :name))
- point and line drawing function accept Vec2 coordinates as well
- more variations
- clojure2d temporary icon

### Changed

- Canvas as a type
- Window as a type (record)
- Helper functions to check if window is visible
- Helper function to get image from canvas and window
- Color manimulations refactored (awt vs vec4)
- Complex type is Vec2 now
- Session management refactored
- Draw function accepts also Window (to access mouse position)
- Examples revisited
- Signal processing optimisations - speed gain 2x
